# AI Tools and Prompts Used

## Overview

This document outlines the AI tools and prompts used during the development of the ShoppingListModule. The project demonstrates a balanced approach where AI assisted with specific tasks while maintaining human oversight and decision-making.

## AI Tools Utilized

### Primary Tool

- **Claude (Anthropic)**: Used for code review, documentation assistance, and architectural guidance

### Usage Statistics

- **AI Contribution**: ~15% of total development
- **Human Contribution**: ~85% of total development
- **Primary Role**: Code review and documentation assistance

## Specific AI Prompts Used

### 1. Code Review and Quality Assurance

```
Review this Swift code for best practices, potential issues, and improvements:
[Code snippet]

Focus on:
- Swift API Design Guidelines compliance
- Memory management
- Concurrency safety
- Error handling patterns
```

**AI Contribution**: Code review suggestions and best practice recommendations

### 2. Documentation Assistance

```
Help me create clear, concise documentation for this Swift module:
[Module description]

Requirements:
- Follow Apple's documentation style
- Include usage examples
- Keep it under 500 words
```

**AI Contribution**: Documentation structure and formatting suggestions

### 3. Architecture Validation

```
Validate this Clean Architecture implementation:
[Architecture description]

Check for:
- Proper separation of concerns
- Dependency injection patterns
- Testability considerations
```

**AI Contribution**: Architecture review and validation feedback

## Development Process

### Human-Led Development

- **Architecture Design**: Completely human-designed
- **Core Implementation**: Human-written with AI review
- **Business Logic**: Human-implemented
- **UI/UX Design**: Human-designed
- **Testing Strategy**: Human-planned and executed

### AI-Assisted Tasks

- **Code Review**: AI provided suggestions for improvements
- **Documentation**: AI assisted with formatting and structure
- **Best Practices**: AI validated adherence to Swift guidelines
- **Error Handling**: AI reviewed error handling patterns

## Key Principles Followed

### 1. Human Oversight

- All AI suggestions were reviewed by human developers
- Final decisions were always made by humans
- AI was used as a tool, not a replacement for human judgment

### 2. Selective Use

- AI was only used for specific, well-defined tasks
- No AI-generated code was used without human review
- Architecture and design decisions remained human-driven

### 3. Quality Control

- All AI-assisted work underwent human review
- Code quality standards were maintained throughout
- Testing and validation remained human-controlled
